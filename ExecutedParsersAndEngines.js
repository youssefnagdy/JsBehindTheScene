/*
   how js code that we write is Executed
   Javascript is always hosted in some environment
   and that is most typically a browser
   such as google chrome fireFox etc...
   and this is where's javascript Runs
   and there are other hosts such as a node-js webServer
   or even some application that accept js code in put
   we well focus on a Browser

   when we write Js-Code and want to Run it
   there is a lot of stuff happening behind the Scenes
   so what happens
   is that the host where js is hosted
   has some kind of javascript Engine
   that takes our code and executed
   so in very simple terms js-Engine is a program
   that executes js code there are many different engines out there
   like googles V8 engine but there others like reno,
   Javascript Core,...etc

   the first thing that happens inside the engine
   is our code is parse by a parser which basically reads
   our code line by line and checks if the syntax
   of the code that we give it is correct so this means
   that the parser knows the js Rules and how has to be
   written in order to be correct to be Valid
   and if you make some mistakes it basically
   thrown an error to stop the execution
   if every thing is correct then the parser producers
   a data structure known as a Abstract Syntax Tree
   which stand Translated into machine code
   so this code is no longer js code
   but a code or lets say a set of instructions
   that can be executed directly by the computer Cpu
   and it's only when our code already converted
   to machine code actually runs and does it work

   so it's not really important that you really memorize all of
   this i just want you to get basic idea of what actually happens
